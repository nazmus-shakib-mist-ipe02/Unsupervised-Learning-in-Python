    "In chapter 1, you used k-means clustering to cluster companies according to their stock price movements. Now, you'll perform hierarchical clustering of the companies. You are given a NumPy array of price movements movements, where the rows correspond to companies, and a list of the company names companies. SciPy hierarchical clustering doesn't fit into a sklearn pipeline, so you'll need to use the normalize() function from sklearn.preprocessing instead of Normalizer.\n",

    "* Rescale the price movements for each stock by using the normalize() function on movements.\n",
    "* Apply the linkage() function to normalized_movements, using 'complete' linkage, to calculate the hierarchical clustering. * * * Assign the result to mergings.\n",
    "* Plot a dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering, using the list companies of company names as the labels. In addition, specify the leaf_rotation=90, and leaf_font_size=6 keyword arguments as you did in the previous exercise."
